# SNAKEBYTE
SnakeByte is a classic snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Control a vibrant red snake, munch on green food, and grow as long as you can without hitting the walls—or yourself!

But beware—one wrong turn and it's game over!

This project blends minimalist design with responsive gameplay, making it both easy to pick up and addictive to master. With clean visuals, smooth controls, and nostalgic charm, SnakeByte is a great project for practicing DOM manipulation and game logic fundamentals.
